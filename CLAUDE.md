## Setup

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and add a Gmail App Password (not your regular password — create one at myaccount.google.com/security → App Passwords).

## Architecture

Two files; one intermediate artifact:

**`fetch_data.py`** pulls from 5+ sources and writes `data/snapshot.json`:
1. FantasyPros HTML (`pd.read_html`) — pitcher and hitter stats across 4 ranges (7/15/30/season)
2. ESPN Fantasy API (`espn_api`) — rosters, FA list, roto box scores, standings, transactions
3. MLB Stats API — probable starters (batch hydrate method) + opponent OPS
4. pybaseball — Statcast contact quality, expected stats, sprint speed, recent game logs

**`send_digest.py`** reads the snapshot, computes all derived metrics, and builds a single self-contained HTML email sent via Gmail SMTP (`smtplib`). The email has two parts: inline HTML body (may be clipped by Gmail at 102 KB) and an attached `digest_YYYY-MM-DD.html` for full render. All new features go here.

**`data/snapshot.json`** is the schema contract between the two files. It is ~1.2MB and not committed.

## Critical gotchas

**Data sources:**
- FanGraphs returns 403 — never use it directly. pybaseball functions work because they handle headers.
- `pitching_stats()` (FanGraphs leaderboard) returns 403. Use `pitching_stats_range()` instead, which scrapes Baseball Reference — but it has no `HLD` column.
- SVHD (saves+holds) is pulled from ESPN player stats via `get_pitcher_espn_svhd()` in fetch_data.py, which reads `pl.stats[0]['breakdown']`. The breakdown uses **string keys** (`'SV'`, `'HLD'`, `'SVHD'`, `'K'`, `'W'`, `'OUTS'`, `'ERA'`, `'WHIP'`, `'GP'`, `'GS'`) — not numeric stat IDs. This is called at fetch time for all rostered and FA pitchers.
- ESPN season stats (`ESPN_SV`, `ESPN_K`, `ESPN_W`, `ESPN_IP`, `ESPN_GS`, `ESPN_GP`, `ESPN_SVHD`) are stored on **all dataset rows** in the snapshot so send_digest.py can use season counts for players who only appear in short-range FantasyPros datasets. `ESPN_SVHD`/`ESPN_SV`/`ESPN_HLD` override `SVHD`/`SV`/`HLD` on `Dataset==YEAR` rows; `ESPN_HLD` is then dropped but `ESPN_SV` is kept on all rows (it's the only way `save_role_watch` can tell a real closer from a holds-only reliever for players outside the FP top-300, who have no YEAR row). Use `_n(r.get("ESPN_SVHD")) or _n(r.get("SVHD"))` (not `if >= 0`) for the fallback — `_n` floors negatives to 0 so `>= 0` is always true.
- xFIP and raw WhiffPct/CSW are not available from FantasyPros pitcher tables (nor FanGraphs — 403). But Baseball Savant (via pybaseball) *does* supply predictive pitcher stats, pulled in `fetch_data.py` and merged on `PlayerName` (broadcasts to all dataset rows): `xERA` + `xwOBA_against` from `get_savant_pitcher_expected()` (absolute values), and `WhiffPctile` (a league whiff **percentile** 0–100, not a rate) from `get_savant_pitcher_skill()`. Plus `BarrelPctAllowed`/`HardHitPctAllowed`/`AvgEVAllowed` from `get_savant_pitcher_contact()`. `pitcher_score`/`rp_score` blend these with the results stats — see the scoring section. Coverage ≈ 90–99% of the FP top-300; missing rows fall back to raw ERA/K% cleanly.
- ESPN injury statuses are `TEN_DAY_DL`, `FIFTEEN_DAY_DL`, `SIXTY_DAY_DL` — not `IL` or `OUT`. The constant `_DL_STATUSES` in send_digest.py covers all of these. FA views and positional breakdown exclude all DL-status players.

**Team name double-space:** `MY_TEAM_NAME = "Guerrero  Warfare"` in fetch_data.py has a double space to match ESPN exactly. `MY_TEAM = "Guerrero Warfare"` in send_digest.py uses a single space for display. Never normalize these to match each other.

**Merge direction:** Pitcher and hitter merges start from FantasyPros as the left side. Players outside the FP top 300 are dropped from short-range (7-day) views but appear in longer ranges.

**PSP sentinel:** `PSP_Date = "1999-01-01"` means no upcoming start. `PSP_Projected = True` means the start was projected via the +6-day rotation rule, not confirmed by the MLB API.

**FA exclusion logic:** Players claimed today are identified by reading today's `transactions` list from the snapshot. The *most recent* transaction per player wins — so add-then-drop-same-day is handled correctly (dropped players re-appear as FA). FA views and positional breakdown replacement options exclude all `_DL_STATUSES` players.

**B_SO is lower-is-better:** `B_SO` (batter strikeouts) is in `_LOWER_BETTER` alongside ERA and WHIP. This affects the Category Pulse bar direction and projection flip logic — having fewer B_SO than the opponent is a win.

**Category Pulse card design:**
- Tied categories use `TEXT` (#e2e8f0, white) for border/value/status — not `YELLOW`. Win = green, loss = red, tie = white.
- ⚡ (close) and flip indicators (▲▼◆) live in an `position:absolute` top-right corner badge, not inline with the status or projection text. The card div is `position:relative`.
- Flip uses `round(pm, dec)` / `round(po, dec)` (display precision) for outcome comparison — raw floats cause false flips when both round to the same displayed value.
- Flip arrow: ▲ green = projecting to flip to a win; ▼ red = projecting to flip to a loss; ◆ white = projecting to flip to a tie.
- Summary line shows W · L · T (T only appended when at least one category is tied).
- Card value (`my score` / `vs opp`) is stacked on two lines (score block + "vs X" below) so decimal-heavy stats (OPS/ERA/WHIP) don't cause width or height inconsistency across the row.

**My Season Category Rankings** (section 14) subtitle shows a pseudo-single-week roto score: `sum(n - rank + 1 for rank in cats.values())` — same scale as a weekly roto score, max = n × 12. Directly comparable to the "This Week's Category Rankings" subtitle score.

**My Upcoming Starts subheader** format: `X starts across Y days | N this wk[, N next wk]`. The "this wk" count is red when 0. The ", N next wk" segment is omitted entirely when next-week count is 0.

**Probable starters:** The primary method uses two MLB API calls (range schedule → batch hydrate). The +6-day rotation projection fills unannounced slots. A live-feed fallback exists if the batch returns nothing.

**Pitcher hot/cold uses 15-day ERA:** `build_pitcher_hot_cold_section`, My Upcoming Starts, and FA Starting Pitchers all compare season ERA vs 15-day ERA (from `p15` index — Dataset==15 rows). The 7-day window is too short for SPs who start infrequently. When a player is absent from the FP 15-day top 300 (fringe starters like Davis Martin), the code falls back to `rec_p` — the pybaseball Baseball Reference 15-day scrape stored in `recent_pitching`. `p15` and `rec_p` are both built in the main build function. Column header is "L15 ERA". `fetch_recent_pitcher_stats` fetches 15 days (not 7) to match this window.

**Statcast name matching:** `lf_to_name()` in fetch_data.py converts Baseball Savant "Last, First" names to "First Last" AND strips accents (e.g. `Ramírez, José` → `Jose Ramirez`) so the merge against FantasyPros ASCII names succeeds. Without accent stripping, accented-name players (Jose Ramirez, etc.) silently lose all Statcast data (xwOBA, Barrel%, SprintSpeed, HR_Probability).

**Roster merge name matching (`merge_on_name` / `_name_key`):** ESPN roster/FA names and FantasyPros names often differ by accents and generational suffixes — ESPN `Luis García Jr.` vs FantasyPros `Luis Garcia` — and an exact-string merge drops the roster link, so a rostered player wrongly shows as a **free agent**. `merge_on_name` (used for both hitter and pitcher roster+FA merges) does the exact merge first, then fills any still-unmatched rows via `_name_key` (accent-stripped, lowercased, trailing Jr./Sr./II/III/IV/V + punctuation removed). Two invariants: (a) exact matches always win — the fallback only fills NaNs, so it can add a match but never change or remove one; (b) a key is trusted only when it maps to a single player on **both** sides, so the several MLB "Luis Garcia" pitchers stay ambiguous and are never guessed. This generalizes the older per-player `HITTER_NAME_PATCHES`/`PITCHER_NAME_PATCHES` (still applied, still fine for odd cases). Takes effect only on a real data refresh, not `--no-refresh` previews.

**Weekly matchup is Monday–Sunday:** `week_end_str` is computed as the Sunday of the current week (`today + timedelta(days=6 - today.weekday())`). FA SP sections and My Upcoming Starts show all starts including next week, but dates past Sunday get a `NEXT WK` badge. The KPI "Starts This Week" and Week at a Glance bullets 2 and 3 count/recommend only within the current matchup week — except on Sundays (see below). **Bullet 2 (rotation coverage) scopes both `confirmed` and `thin_days` to `PSP_Date <= week_end`** so its start count matches the "Starts This Week" KPI exactly — `my_starts_by_day` spans this week AND next (two-start rotations push starts into next week), and without the filter bullet 2 showed e.g. 10 while the KPI showed 8.

**Two-start pitchers (`PSP_Dates`):** `fetch_data.py` now preserves a list of ALL upcoming start dates per pitcher (`PSP_Dates`, plus parallel `PSP_HomeVAways`) via `_attach_start_lists` before the one-row-per-pitcher dedup. The scalar `PSP_Date`/`PSP_HomeVAway`/`PSP_Projected` remain the earliest start (unchanged for existing consumers). `_starts_this_week(r, today, week_end)` in send_digest counts entries within the matchup week (falls back to the scalar `PSP_Date` for old snapshots). A pitcher with ≥ 2 starts Mon–Sun gets a bold green `2-START` chip (`two_start_badge()`) in FA SP + My Upcoming Starts, and is preferred (secondary sort key, NOT a score change) in the Week-at-a-Glance best-FA-SP bullet, which appends "×2 starts this week". Note: two-start weeks are only visible when both starts fall in the window — mid-week runs usually show 0 because the +6 rotation pushes the 2nd start into next week; the signal lights up on Mon/Tue runs. Never fold two-start into the 0–100 score (keeps scores normalized).

**Save-Role Watch (`save_role_watch`):** SVHD is the most volatile category. **Recent holds are NOT available anywhere in the pipeline** — per-window (`Dataset` 7/15/30) `SVHD` captures recent SAVES only (FantasyPros windows have no HLD), and ESPN exposes only season totals (no rolling 15-day split — verified: `pl.stats` has keys 0/98/99, none a usable window). So recency is save-only. The function flags (a) **emerging FA closers** — FA RP with ≥ 3 saves in the last 15 days — and (b) **fading rostered closers** — my RP gated on **season saves `ESPN_SV` ≥ 5** (a real closer) with 0 recent saves despite pitching (≥ 3 recent appearances). The fading side is gated on season *saves*, not SV+H, specifically so a holds-based reliever (e.g. JoJo Romero: 0 SV / 20 HLD — whose recent hold production we can't see) is never falsely flagged as fading. Rendered as a callout appended to the FA Relief Pitchers section.

**Category classification (`classify_categories`):** Returns `{cat: (proj_res, tier)}` reusing Category Pulse's projection math (`_project` + `pit_proj` for K/QS/W). Tier is only `tossup` (margin ≤ `_CLOSE_THRESH` — a thin lead/deficit) or `leaning`. **There is no `locked` tier / no 🔒 badge** — lock detection was removed because it mislabeled mid-week margins as clinched (a category could show "locked" and a flip arrow simultaneously). Now used solely to detect a THIN ERA/WHIP lead for the ratio-stat pickup warning. Computed once in `build_email` as `category_classification` and passed to `_roster_suggestion`; `build_category_pulse` no longer takes it, and the pickup steering no longer prunes "dead" categories (targets all losing cats).

**HR% column (`_hrp_cell`):** `HR_Probability` (computed in `fetch_data.compute_hr_probability` from barrel%, hard-hit%, launch angle, HR/AB, xwOBA, ISO, recent HR streak; range ≈ 0.05–0.31, a modeled per-game HR probability) is surfaced as a color-coded `HR%` column in Roster Hot/Cold and FA Hitters via `_hrp_cell(row)`, which also renders a hover `title` tooltip of the underlying drivers (Barrel% · HardHit% · EV · xwOBA · ISO). Green ≥ 20%, yellow ≥ 14%. `_hrp_cell` takes the full player row (needs the Statcast fields), so Roster Hot/Cold stashes the season row as `srow`. **`compute_hr_probability` measures power SKILL, not availability** — it must NOT gate on `ESPN_Status` (an earlier status gate returned 0.0 for any injured/recently-injured or "Unknown"-status player, which zeroed out Judge/Trout/Buxton despite intact power). It returns 0.0 only when there's no usable signal at all (no HR rate and no Statcast), so those show "—". `ISO` is derived as `SLG − AVG` in `fetch_data` (the FP feed omits it); `HR_per_AB`/`ISO`/`Barrel_Pct`/`HardHit_Pct`/`MaxEV`/`xwOBA` are in `enrich_cols` so all rows carry them for the tooltip.

**Hot/Cold Score columns:** Both `build_pitcher_hot_cold_section` and `build_hot_cold_section` take a `best_recent_*` index and render a role-aware Score badge (pitcher → `_score_p`, hitter → `_blend(hitter_score)`) — same normalized number shown everywhere else for that player.

**Ratio-stat risk guardrail:** In `_roster_suggestion`, when the chosen add is an SP (`_is_sp`) and ERA or WHIP is a currently-won **tossup** (thin lead, per `classify_categories`), and the candidate's ERA > 4.20 / WHIP > 1.30, the pickup bullet appends a yellow `⚠ boosts K/W/QS but his {ERA} {cat} over ~{IP} IP risks your thin {cat} lead.` IP is `IP_per_G × _starts_this_week`, formatted via `_fmt_ip`. A good-ERA streamer, or a comfortable (non-tossup) lead, correctly produces no warning.

**Sunday mode (`is_sunday`):** When `datetime.now().weekday() == 6`, the digest shifts to a next-week preview. Changes: header subtitle → "Weekly Lookahead"; email subject → "Lookahead"; KPI tile → "Starts Next Week" (counts starts after `week_end_str`); Category Pulse subtitle → "Final stretch — week ends today"; Week at a Glance box → "Next Week Preview" label; bullet 1 appends "— final" instead of "through Day N"; bullet 2 shows next-week confirmed starts; bullet 3 shows best FA SP for next week. `next_week_end_str` is `today + timedelta(days=13 - today.weekday())` and is available in `build_email` scope.

**SP/RP role detection uses `_is_sp(r)`:** Never use `"SP" in pos` or `gs > 3` alone. The helper uses a priority chain: ESPN season GS/GP ratio (≥ 5 appearances) → dataset GS/G ratio (≥ 4 appearances) → IP/G → Position field. Thresholds: GS/G ≥ 0.80 → SP, ≤ 0.20 → RP; IP/G ≥ 4.5 → SP, < 2.5 → RP. All SP/RP-sensitive functions use it: `pitcher_score`, `_score_p`, `fa_starters`, `fa_relievers`, My RP filter, `positional_breakdown`.

**Unified role scores — a player shows the SAME score in every section.** Three canonical role scores, all calibrated to the shared 0–100 scale (p50→50, p90→80): SP → `_score_p` (blended `pitcher_score`), RP → `rp_score` (never blended — built on ESPN season counting stats, and skipping the blend keeps the number identical across My RP, FA RP, and Positional Breakdown), Hitter → `_blend(r, hitter_score, best_recent_h)`. Never score a section with a different function than the others use for the same role — that's how Ashby showed 72 in one table and 58 in another. `sp_fa_score` (pitcher_score + hidden start bonus) was removed for this reason; the FA SP Score column now equals the My Upcoming Starts badge for the same pitcher.

**Dynamic volume benchmarks (no hard-coded IP/AB/GS minimums):** "Full-time" / "big enough sample" thresholds are **derived from the live snapshot each run** so they scale as the season progresses instead of a fixed number that goes stale (a 225-AB "regular" line is right in July, absurd in September). Two builders, both called once at the top of `build_email`:
- `compute_ab_benchmarks(hitters)` → module global `_AB_BENCH[window]` = `_AB_LEADER_FRAC` (0.62) × the window's p95 (leader) AB. Consumed by `_ab_opportunity_mult` in `hitter_score`. `_FULLTIME_AB` is a cold-start fallback only (early season / a window with < 20 hitters).
- `compute_pitcher_benchmarks(pitchers)` → module global `_PIT_BENCH[(window, role)]` = leader IP/GS/GP (p95) per role, `_is_sp`-split. `_ip_reliability_mult` uses `_IP_RELY_FRAC` (0.20) × leader IP for the row's window+role as the small-sample floor inside `pitcher_score` (replaces the old flat `ip/20` — which wrongly penalized *recent-window* rows too, since nobody has 20 IP in a 15-day window; now window-relative so recent form is trusted). `_pit_viable_min(role, stat)` uses `_GS_VIABLE_FRAC`/`_GP_VIABLE_FRAC`/`_IP_VIABLE_FRAC` (0.17/0.30/0.38) × the season leader for the `positional_breakdown` viable-FA filter (replaces `GS≥3` / `GP≥12` / `IP≥20`) and the recalibration population. `_PIT_FALLBACK` holds the old constants for cold start.
- All fractions were chosen so the derived floors ≈ the old hard-codes **today** (SP rely ≈ 20.4 IP, SP viable ≈ 3.06 GS, RP viable ≈ 12 GP / 19.8 IP), so the change is calibration-neutral now (`recalibrate_scores.py` prints the same constants) and only diverges as the season grows. p95 (not max) is the "leader" for outlier robustness.

**Week at a Glance pickup bullet (bullet 4):** Shows positions for both the add and the drop (via `_pos_disp`, which hides the generic `P` tag). Drop selection is position-aware: weakest droppable player sharing a `POS_GROUPS` group with the add first (adding an OF drops the worst OF, not an infielder), then same player type (pit/hit), then any droppable. `_can_drop` still guards that every position keeps ≥ 1 healthy player.

**FA RP requires SVHD ≥ 1:** `fa_relievers` gates on `(_n(r.get("ESPN_SVHD")) or _n(r.get("SVHD"))) >= 1`. A pitcher with zero saves and zero holds all season has no role and should not be recommended.

**Score cascade (`best_recent_p` / `best_recent_h`):** Built in `build_email` by merging `{**rec_p_fp, **p7, **p15, **p30}` (pitchers) and `{**rec_h, **h7, **h15, **h30}` (hitters) — later dicts win, so 30d FP > 15d FP > 7d FP > Baseball Ref. `rec_p_fp` is `recent_pitching` with computed `K/IP = K/IP` and `IP_per_G = IP/G` added so `pitcher_score` can use it. These dicts are passed to `_blend` and `positional_breakdown`. Coverage: ~500 pitchers / ~460 hitters vs 300 from 30d alone.

**`positional_breakdown` viable filter:** FA pool for each position excludes benchies. SP: `GS >= _pit_viable_min("SP","GS")`. RP: `ESPN_GP >= _pit_viable_min("RP","GP") or IP >= _pit_viable_min("RP","IP")` (dynamic, ≈ `GS≥3` / `GP≥12` / `IP≥20` today — see "Dynamic volume benchmarks"). Hitters: `OPS > 0.200 or R+RBI > 5`. FA quality (`fa_quality`) = avg blended score of top-3 viable FAs. Scarcity thresholds: `< 50` → scarce (RED), `< 60` → moderate (YELLOW), `>= 60` → deep (MUTED).

**Category Pulse `days_elapsed`:** `days_elapsed = datetime.now().weekday()` (Mon=0 … Sun=6). ESPN stats are through *yesterday*, so today is always remaining — do not add 1. Guard: `day_clause = f' through Day {days_elapsed}' if days_elapsed > 0 else ' (week starting)'`.

**Category Pulse pitcher projections (K, QS, W):** These three use actual remaining starts × per-start rate instead of historical weekly averages. Computed in `build_email` as `pit_proj = {"QS": {"my": ..., "opp": ...}, "K": ..., "W": ...}` from pitchers with `PSP_Date >= today and <= week_end_str`. Passed to `build_category_pulse(remaining_proj=pit_proj)`. Rate/hitter cats (ERA, WHIP, OPS, R, HR, RBI, SB, B_SO, SVHD) still use historical averages via `compute_weekly_avgs`.

**Dry-run preview filenames:** Always `previews/digest_preview_{team_slug}.html` (e.g. `digest_preview_Guerrero_Warfare.html`, `digest_preview_Giga_Vlad.html`). The old `digest_preview.html` fallback is gone — always slug-based regardless of whether `--team` is passed.

## Scoring functions (send_digest.py)

- `_is_sp(r)` → bool. Usage-based SP/RP detection. Priority: ESPN season GS/GP → dataset GS/G → IP/G → Position field. See gotcha above.
- `_blend(r, score_fn, idx_recent, w=0.4)` → blended score. 40% recent (best available window) + 60% season. `idx_recent` is `best_recent_p` or `best_recent_h` (see below). Falls back to `score_fn(r)` if player has no recent row.
- `_score_p(r, idx_recent=None)` → canonical role-aware pitcher score. SP → `_blend(r, pitcher_score, idx_recent)`; RP → `rp_score(r)` unblended. Used by every pitcher Score display/sort: FA SP (`fa_starters`), My Upcoming Starts badge, `positional_breakdown`, and Week at a Glance add/drop pools. See "Unified role scores" gotcha.
- `_starts_this_week(r, today, week_end)` → int. Count of the pitcher's upcoming starts within the matchup week (from `PSP_Dates`; falls back to scalar `PSP_Date`). Drives the `2-START` badge and best-FA-SP preference. See "Two-start pitchers" gotcha.
- `save_role_watch(pitchers, my_team, claimed)` → `(emerging, fading)` lists for the Save-Role Watch callout. See gotcha.
- `classify_categories(matchup, weekly_avgs, days_elapsed, remaining_proj)` → `{cat: (proj_res, tier)}`. Powers 🔒 lock badges + pickup steering. See gotcha.
- `opponent_week_intel(pitchers, hitters, opp_team, best_recent_h, today, week_end)` → dict (starts, two-start pitchers, hot hitters) for the Opponent This Week block. Returns None when `opp_team` is empty.
- `pitcher_score(r, _raw=False)` → 0–100. Role-aware via `_is_sp(r)`. **Blended advanced/results scoring** (added 2026-07-02). K component (28): results-based K% (`Kpct_P`, else K/IP) **blended 60/40** with `WhiffPctile` (a Baseball Savant league whiff PERCENTILE 0–100, not a rate) when present. Run-prevention (28): actual `ERA` **blended 55/45** with `xERA` (Savant deserved-ERA, absolute) when both present. WHIP (20): results only. **Contact-quality-allowed (0–12, NEW)**: `BarrelPctAllowed` (0–5, lower better) + `xwOBA_against` (0–7, ~.360→0 scale). **SP path**: role bonus 9–12 based on GS volume; SVHD ignored. **RP path**: role bonus 5–12 scaled by SVHD + W + IP/G (note: `_score_p` routes all RPs to `rp_score`, so this RP branch is effectively never displayed — `pitcher_score` is calibrated on the SP distribution only). All advanced blends **fall back to the raw stat** when the Savant field is missing (`_n` floors the `-1` sentinel to 0). **Small-sample penalty**: `s *= min(1.0, ip / 20)` before calibration. Calibrated to p50=50, p90=80: `s * 1.4341 - 39.957`. `_raw=True` returns the pre-calibration score (used by `recalibrate_scores.py`).
- `rp_score(r, _raw=False)` → 0–100 composite for RP ranking. Counting stats stay dominant: SVHD (40) · K (22) · W (13) · IP/G (10), from `ESPN_SVHD`/`ESPN_K`/`ESPN_W` with FantasyPros fallback. Run-prevention (9): `ERA` **blended 50/50** with `xERA`. WHIP (6). **Contact-quality-allowed (0–8, NEW)**: `BarrelPctAllowed` (0–4) + `WhiffPctile` (0–4). Advanced blends fall back to raw when missing. Calibrated: `s * 0.9336 + 12.847` (p50→50, p90→80; elite closers land ~95). Used by FA RP, My Relief Pitchers, and (via `_score_p`) every RP-scoring section. My Relief Pitchers picks the best available dataset per player (YEAR → 30 → 15 → 7). `_raw=True` returns the pre-calibration score.
- **Recalibration:** when the raw component mix of `pitcher_score`/`rp_score` changes, rerun `python recalibrate_scores.py` (reads the snapshot, computes raw distributions via `_raw=True`, prints new `p50→50 / p90→80` constants) and paste the constants back. Qualified populations are now **dynamic/role-relative** (see "Dynamic volume benchmarks" below), not fixed IP/GP — recalibrate imports `compute_pitcher_benchmarks` + `_pit_viable_min` so its population matches send_digest's. Because the benchmarks scale with the season, the qualified population drifts over time; rerun periodically (not just on a component-mix change) to keep p50/p90 honest.
- `hitter_score(r)` → 0–100. Prefers wRC+ over OPS. Uses xwOBA, sprint speed, Barrel%, ISO, HR_Probability. **Opportunity multiplier** (`_ab_opportunity_mult`): the rate components would score a part-time masher like a regular, but over a week a bench bat who gets ~1 AB every few games can't accumulate counting stats — so the raw score is scaled by AB vs a full-time benchmark (floored at `_AB_FLOOR = 0.40`, capped at 1.0). A full-time hitter lands at 1.0 (no penalty, calibration anchors untouched). Calibrated: `s * 1.587 - 5.2`. Displayed everywhere as `_blend(r, hitter_score, best_recent_h)` — `fa_hitters` takes `idx_recent` for this.
- `qs_probability(r)` → 1–99. Calibrated to league-average ~38%, ace ~75%. Uses IP/G (not IP/GS).
- `_fmt_ip(ip_decimal)` → baseball IP string. Converts true decimal (5.333) to notation (5.1). Formula: `whole = int(d); outs = round((d-whole)*3); if outs>=3: whole+=1, outs=0`. Used in Proj. Line display for both FA SP and My Upcoming Starts.
- `_proj_line_html(r)` → `IP · ER · K` span. ER is adjusted for opponent strength and park: `raw_er * opp_factor * park_factor`. `opp_factor = clamp(opp_ops / 0.717, 0.80, 1.20)` where `_LEAGUE_AVG_OPS = 0.717`. `park_factor = 0.97` if `PSP_HomeVAway` starts with `"vs "` (home), `1.03` if `"@ "` (away), else `1.0`. K is not adjusted (no team K% in snapshot). Both fields are already on the pitcher row.
- `hot_cold_cell(season_val, recent_val, ..., no_data_title=None)` → `<td>` with colored recent stat + 🔥/↑/❄/↓ icon vs season baseline. When recent_val is missing/zero and `no_data_title` is set, renders `—` with a dotted underline and hover tooltip explaining the absence.
- `band_divider(label, color)` → full-width `<div>` with centered label between `BORDER` lines. Used at band boundaries in final assembly.

## Key data fields

**Pitchers:** `PlayerName`, `FantasyTeam`, `Position`, `Dataset` (7/15/30/2026), `IP`, `K`, `ERA`, `WHIP`, `GS`, `SVHD`, `K/IP`, `Kpct_P`, `IP_per_G`, `PSP_Date`, `PSP_HomeVAway`, `PSP_Projected`, `PSP_Dates` (list of all upcoming starts), `PSP_HomeVAways` (parallel list), `Team_OPS_Value`, `BarrelPctAllowed`, `HardHitPctAllowed`, `AvgEVAllowed`, `xERA`, `xwOBA_against`, `WhiffPctile`, `ESPN_SV`, `ESPN_K`, `ESPN_W`, `ESPN_IP`, `ESPN_GS`, `ESPN_GP`, `ESPN_SVHD`

**Hitters:** `PlayerName`, `FantasyTeam`, `Position`, `Dataset`, `HR`, `RBI`, `R`, `SB`, `AVG`, `OPS`, `wRCplus`, `xwOBA`, `xBA`, `xSLG`, `SprintSpeed`, `ISO`, `Barrel_Pct`, `HardHit_Pct`, `HR_Probability`

**Roto:** `Team`, `Week`, `Roto_Score`, `{CAT}_Points` for each of 12 categories

Numeric missing values are stored as `-1` (not `NaN`) after the merge pipelines run.

## Digest section order (send_digest.py body_parts)

Five bands separated by full-width `band_divider()` rules (centered label between `BORDER` lines). The Triage divider only renders when `alert_section` is non-empty.

**Jump-to nav (`nav_bar`)** — a pill bar at the very top of the body (`My Roster · Free Agents · Season`) with anchor links to the `band_divider(..., anchor=...)` targets (`band-myroster`, `band-fa`, `band-season`). Anchors are `<a name= id=>` for max email-client support; they jump in the browser-rendered attachment and degrade to harmless styled links inline where Gmail ignores fragment jumps. This is the deliberate substitute for real tabs, which need JS/CSS that Gmail strips. `nav_bar` also drops a `<a name="top" id="top">` anchor; every anchored `band_divider` renders a right-aligned `↑ TOP` back-link (with a matching-width left spacer so the band label stays centered) so a reader who jumped down can return without scrolling.

**⚑ ALERTS** (conditional)
1. Roster Alerts

**MY ROSTER**
2. Week at a Glance
3. Category Pulse (projection cards)
3b. Opponent This Week — scouting block (`opponent_week_intel` / `opp_preview_section`), placed directly below Category Pulse: opponent's start count, two-start pitchers, top-3 hot bats by recent OPS, season roto strengths/weaknesses (top-3 / bottom-3 categories via `category_ranks`), and wire activity (count of their `FA ADDED` transactions in the recent window → very active / moderate / quiet). Logo uses `fantasy_logo()` so a dead ESPN URL falls back to an emoji avatar (raw `<img>` rendered blank). Renders only when the opponent has starters or hot hitters.
4. Current Matchup — category rankings (renamed from "This Week's Category Rankings"; sits above the score banner)
5. Matchup (score banner + category table)

**MY ROSTER** (Positional Breakdown sits first so the biggest roster holes lead)
10. Positional Breakdown
6. My Upcoming Starts
7. My Relief Pitchers
8. Pitcher Hot/Cold (15-day vs season ERA; has a role-aware Score badge column via `_score_p`)
9. Roster Hot/Cold (hitters, 7-day vs season OPS; has HR% and a `hitter_score` Score badge column)

**FREE AGENTS**
11. FA Pickup — Starting Pitchers
12. FA Pickup — Relief Pitchers
13. FA Pickup — Hitters

**SEASON**
14. My Season Category Rankings
15. League Luck Standings

**FA Starting Pitchers table columns:** Pitcher · Proj. Line · Matchup · Opp OPS · QS% · ERA · L15 ERA · K% · Score. "Pos" was removed (redundant for SPs). "Proj. Line" shows projected `IP · ER · K` per start, with IP in baseball notation via `_fmt_ip()` (decimal 5.333 → "5.1", 5.667 → "5.2"). Date header rows span `colspan="9"` with background on `<tr>` (not `<td>`) for full-width highlight.

**My Upcoming Starts table columns:** Pitcher · Proj. Line · Matchup · Opp OPS · QS% · ERA · L15 ERA · K% · Score. Same Proj. Line formula as FA SP. Date header rows span `colspan="9"`.

**`--team` flag:** `python send_digest.py --team "Team Name"` shows a full digest from another team's perspective. All sections render correctly including Category Pulse and Matchup score banner. Requires a fresh snapshot (run `fetch_data.py` first) since `all_matchups` must be present. Falls back to `current_matchup` (Guerrero Warfare only) for old snapshots. `build_matchup_section` accepts `my_team` param (default `MY_TEAM` constant) so it renders the correct team name and logo.

**My Upcoming Starts badges:** `2-START` (green, when `_starts_this_week ≥ 2`), QS (green) and 5K+ (yellow) badges shown next to pitcher name. QS fires at qs_probability ≥ 51%; 5K+ fires at K/IP ≥ 0.90 or K% ≥ 24% with IP/G ≥ 4.5.

## Color palette

```python
BG="#080e1c"  SURFACE="#101827"  SURFACE2="#0d1424"  BORDER="#1e2d45"
TEXT="#e2e8f0"  MUTED="#64748b"  ACCENT="#3b82f6"
GREEN="#22c55e"  RED="#ef4444"  YELLOW="#f59e0b"
```

My team name is always styled `font-weight:800;color:{ACCENT}` with a ← arrow.

## Automation

- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/daily-digest.yml` triggers at 06:00 and 15:00 UTC (2 AM / 11 AM EDT). GitHub's scheduler is unreliable — actual delays vary 1–4 hours, so expected delivery is roughly 4–6 AM / 1–3 PM EDT. **Cron is always UTC** — no GitHub account or org timezone setting affects it. ESPN credentials are stored as repo secrets (`ESPN_SWID`, `ESPN_S2`).
- **Local runner:** `scripts/run_digest.bat` can be used for manual local runs. It captures full console output (incl. tracebacks) to `logs/run_console.log`; the structured one-line-per-send record is written separately by `send_digest.py` to `logs/digest.log`. They are deliberately kept in **separate files** — the old setup redirected the `.bat`'s stdout into `digest.log` while Python also appended to it, and the two handles collided (`PermissionError` on Windows). The Python write is now wrapped so a locked log can never crash a run that already sent.
